# 📰 Multi-Modal Fake News Detection using HAMMER++

> A deep learning pipeline that detects fake news using both textual and visual content, powered by the HAMMER++ multi-modal transformer.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to detect fake news articles by leveraging both text and image modalities. It uses the powerful [HAMMER++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03203) architecture, which performs hierarchical attention across modalities. Weights & Biases is used for experiment tracking, and the model is trained and validated on real-world fake news datasets like BoomLive and AltNews.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Backbone**: HAMMER++
- **Input**: Text (e.g., headline, content) + Image (e.g., article/post image)
- **Embedding**: ViT & BERT
- **Training losses**:
  - Classification Loss
  - Grounding Loss (optional, currently disabled)
- **Framework**: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers
